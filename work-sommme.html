                    <p class="content">There are many wine applications that exist in the market, but most are cumbersome and content heavy which do not achieve the knowledge acquisition objective, nor do they increase an understanding or an appreciation for how the right pairing can enhance a meal. With the applications that exist, there are many that provide specific label recommendations that link to purchase options often driven by paid advertising.</p> 
                    <p class="content">The driving requirements for SommMe were for an approachable, understandable, personal, and accurate wine pairing recommendation tool that will make users explore and interact with pairings and understand more about the world of wine.  </p>
                    <h4 class="mini-title">SOLUTION</h4>
                    <p class="content">It was clear that there was a gap and a need for a mobile application that utilized in-app chat interactions based on specific questions and metrics; resulting in quality, personalized food and wine pairing recommendations.  We found that by utilizing emerging chatbot technology we found the solution to address the revealed and recurring problems with wine applications and options filtering. </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li class="content">Users were eager to get quick and simple information to enhance their wine experience, they were not looking to obtain in-depth information nor to chat with a live sommelier.</li>
                        <li class="content">Clear priority and need for accurate and personalized wine pairing recommendations.</li>
                        <li class="content">There was no user demand for an exclusive live chat with a sommelier - only 1 user out of the 27 surveyed actually felt that would be a preferred.</li>
                        <li class="content">An emerging need for a mobile application that utilized in-app chat based on questions and resulting in quality food and wine pairing recommendations.</li>

                    <p class="content">Keeping user personas and user stories in mind, I began to target an MVP that allowed for the ability to interact with an in-app chat with an expert for wine pairings. At this point, through building user flows I was able to outline and start to pull together the experience. All of the scenarios were outlined in the user flows to build the first low-fidelity wireframes for SommMe.</p>

                    <h4 class="mini-title">WIREFRAMING</h4>
                    <p class="content">After sketching multiple concepts and designing prototypes to solve this problem, we found this to be a prime opportunity to utilize a new platform to address the recurring problems with chatbot technology even though it has not been used in this realm. As outlined in the user research data, the ability to have access to personalized wine recommendations without feeling intimidated and without being forced to purchase was key and we worked through an agile process to design an interactive prototype for the mobile application ready handoff for development.</p>
                    <p class="content">The next step after addressing user flows was to wireframe a clear and simple way for users to engage with the SommMe chat for pairings.  I sketched rapid low-fidelity wireframes and used a clickable prototype with InvisionApp to facilitate an internal discovery of the user’s journey.</p>
                    <p class="content">Moving on to high-fidelity wireframes, we identified the information architecture for the SommMe chat and the homepage and pairings flows.</p>

                    <p class="content"><b>What worked?</b> The fact that there is a confirmed and clear gap between users that want recommendations and the resources out there to get accurate and personalized recommendations. Users are open to chatbot technology and a user experience that flows with a conversation for recommendations.</p>
                    <p class="content"><b>What didn’t work?</b> A live chat feature. I envisioned this being an actual service to the user. But, I found out that people aren’t interested to pay for live help, rather to have an exploratory tool where they could access information that has been filtered and personalized based on a criteria was sufficient.</p>
                    <p class="content">Through applying user feedback and the overall goals of what we were wanting to accomplish, the empathetic process of research and design gave a clear direction for designing an effective solution to the problem. </p>
